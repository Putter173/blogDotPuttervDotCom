      <description>The title basically refers to how quickly this week went, it was as quick as the velocity of spacecrafts in Low Earth Orbit. (Not sure if anybody would know that reference, nor would it be that funny but I hope someone finds joy in it ðŸ˜‚). Within this week only two days out of the usual five days contain classes, and therefore I may have had been a bit of a &amp;ldquo;lazy slob&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>For the fist time in over five years of being unable to attend school, I finally had the opportunity of attending the School of Global Studies&amp;rsquo;s Global Studies &amp;amp; Social Entrepreneurship program. In this series of articles I will explore my experiences during the course of the program on a weekly biases.
Moving in prior to the start of the program Me and my roommate &amp;ldquo;Perry&amp;rdquo; moved in to our dorm (Haus Private Residences) on Saturday the 2nd of July.</description>
