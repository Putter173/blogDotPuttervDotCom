&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The title basically refers to how quickly this week went, it was as quick as the velocity of spacecrafts in Low Earth Orbit. (Not sure if anybody would know that reference, nor would it be that funny but I hope someone finds joy in it ðŸ˜‚). Within this week only two days out of the usual five days contain classes, and therefore I may have had been a bit of a "lazy slob".

## First Two Days!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monday started off rather relaxingly, with p'Bass's and p'Moji's lecture about their university experience and their fun activities! (I'd like to note here that I love all our activities that all our lectureres make us participate in.) Following that was a rather facinating lecture conducted by Professor Altaf about identity and globalization. He did not utilized any slides and the content covered, and yet the content he covered was broad and fathomless. And to be honest the notes I took during this class displayed my inability to dischage the knowledge I gained into words. (This will happen again later in the week.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tuesday began with an exciting class in public speaking conducted by Professor Paul. Unrelatedly his class was the first class to be conducted with all the windows opened, his concern for the students' health was rather refreshing (not saying that other professors didn't care for our health but, he did what he belived was best for us.) The following lecture was something was I was rather concered about. It was a lecture about development from a gender perspective conducted by Professor Piya. The reason I was concerned about this lecture was that I am rather awkward in reguards to anything about gender conversations. Not that I have anything against nor am I insecure about the subject. The thing is generally the only gender inequality I have experienced are those that are classified as traditional things my mother had taught me you know chiverly: opening doors for the ladies, walk on the side next to the road, let woman enter first and the like. Any my mother set an example of a strong indepent person. A thing that surprised my peers was that, I barely if ever saw my mother wearing makeup. So for most of my life, until this class, I had thougt that any woman can withstand the sociatal pressure of makeup. (Partly also the reason I keep telling my female friends not to wear makeup, ladies your beatiful as you are.) Apparently not, in the discussions we had within our group. I actually had a rather interesting conversation with Yutika about this: is it a woman's own opinion to wear makeup (as in the woman in quesion likes makeup), or is it the conditioning by society.

## The Great Rest.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried working at first but as all anixety filled brains would, I ended up playing my current favorite game instead: Kerbal Space Program (KSP). Basically I spent Wednesday and Thursday either atempting to work, or building my Space Station & Moon Survey Satellite in KSP (Pictured Below).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friday, lightning struck my brain (metaphorically of course). I finnaly realized why adults would picture me more as a CVO rather than the CEO. I have visions and ideas but enforcing them and putting pen to paper is an entirely diffent matter. (Props to Acre, he's the REAL boss) We had a meeting and while I was contributive, my own work was (In my opinion) rather inadequate. We spent six hours together and I merely only wrote enough to fill half a page. But if any questions arises of why we have to do things in a certian way I can answer them with a logical explination, such as why our project is an independent endeavour and not a colloboration between exsisting parties (answer's funding BTW, I mean it's deeper than that but that's all I'm going to write here), or why we need to use some exsisting frameworks instead of creating a new freamework that would perhaps be better, and etc..

Note: Sadly our other member (Monic) was unable to attend our meeting, also we all tested negative for covid before we all met up.
