&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the words of my good friend "This week was hell-ish." This week we went on two field trips! First, at a start-up founded by our very GSSE alumnis: Rambler Organic Farm, and second NECTEC (National Electronics and Computer Technology Center).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The field trip at Rambler was quite fun and educational. We also had hands-on experience helping them farm, though say may say it was unpaid labour. It was very interesting observe their business model and their ideologies.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While everyone was basically falling asleep at the NECTEC field trip, the lectures provided interesting perspectives. Especially the lecture on Conversational AI. To me one incredibily important quesion that came up to me during the lecture was: Is it worth it poetentially invading user privacy to have an virtual assistant that can be conversational? (Context: More advanced virtual assistants generally have been know to invade user privacy more than older generations of virtual assistants, prime example of this would be Modern Google Assistants & Amazon Alex, compared to Apple's Siri.)
