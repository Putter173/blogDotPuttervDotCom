&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drive through any major city in Southeast Asia today—Bangkok, Jakarta, Manila, Kuala Lumpur—and you will see the same thing: modernized glass towers that could belong anywhere from Singapore to Houston. The people may speak different languages, but the architecture feels identical. This sameness is deliberate. It signals that we have arrived, that we are "developed," that we are on the path of progress.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But where is our culture in these cities? Traditional Southeast Asian architecture—wooden houses on stilts, intricate temple roofs, community courtyards—survives only in rural areas dismissed as "uncivilized." In cities, we eat prepackaged foods to maximize productivity. In slums and villages, people still cook together, talk in their communities, and live in ways cities have abandoned for efficiency.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the paradox: to appear modern, we erase what makes us distinct. Our cities perform progress through imitation. And it's not just our buildings performing—it's all of us.

## The Trap of Endless Climbing

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urbanisation has long symbolized progress. Gleaming skylines and rising GDP promise prosperity. Yet for many young people, urbanisation now represents exhaustion. Families migrate seeking better education and jobs, only to find new forms of inequality, insecurity, and debt. Everyone climbs toward something, yet no one arrives. We're performing success we cannot afford, chasing "development" that keeps moving out of reach.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This isn't just economics—it's psychological. Two development theories explain why: **neoliberalism** and **dependency theory**.

- **Neoliberalism** tells us success is individual responsibility. Work hard enough, study hard enough, buy the right things, and you'll "make it." When you fail, it's not the system—it's your failure. This ideology drives endless competition and consumerism, measuring human worth through economic productivity and material accumulation.

- **Dependency theory** exposes the structural trap: Global South countries remain dependent on Northern economic systems, consumption patterns, and cultural validation. The same logic operates within nations—provincial areas depend on Bangkok; the middle class imitates the elite; the elite seek Western recognition. Urbanisation becomes not just movement of people, but internalization of dependency—a cascade where each class performs for the one above.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together, these forces create what we see today: cities built not for citizens but for capital, and citizens trapped performing success they cannot afford.

## The Cascade: Neoliberalism's Ladder

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hierarchy manifests clearly across Thailand's education system. Government school students and their families can scarcely imagine life beyond their immediate surroundings, their hopes fixed on Bangkok's promise. Private school families share similar aspirations, but the city feels less like a dream and more like a choice—a stepping stone rather than destination. In international schools, where tuition rivals Western universities, competition shifts outward: students compare themselves not to Bangkok peers but to Ivy League admits abroad.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**This is neoliberalism in action:** it creates a ladder where everyone believes the next rung brings fulfillment, yet reaching it only reveals another rung above. Provincial families send children to Bangkok, convinced capital education guarantees better life. Yet Bangkok's middle class drowns in debt—household debt hovers around 90% of GDP, among Asia's highest. Car loans, credit cards, private school fees entrap families financially. Still, the middle class aspires upward to the elite, whose children attend international schools and vacation abroad. Even among the wealthy, success is measured not by stability but global validation: English fluency, Western passports, multinational careers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neoliberal promise is that individual effort determines outcomes. The reality is that each class is structurally positioned to chase the next, keeping everyone in perpetual motion without destination. **This insecurity is not a bug—it's the feature that keeps the system running.**

## Cities as Theaters: Dependency's Architecture

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urbanisation concentrates this performance. Rural migrants arrive seeking opportunity but find precarious work, rising rent, limited mobility. City dwellers shoulder debt and competition. Governments celebrate infrastructure and foreign investment as progress, rarely asking who benefits.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**This is dependency theory's prediction:** development remains externally oriented, shaped by global market demands rather than local needs. When Bangkok replaces traditional shophouses with glass towers, when families debt-finance Western education, these choices perform development for an imagined global audience. The colonization our grandparents resisted politically, we now embrace culturally.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pattern repeats regionally. Jakarta sinks yet builds luxury malls while settlements flood—serving global capital's real estate interests while abandoning citizens to climate vulnerability. Manila's gleaming Makati coexists with millions in precarious housing. Ho Chi Minh City races toward "smart city" status while motorbike taxi drivers face algorithmic exploitation through foreign ride-hailing apps.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each city performs modernity differently, but the script is the same: **development as performance for global capital, not service to local citizens.** Under neoliberal policy, cities attract investment, not nurture communities. Under dependency logic, "development" means copying Northern models regardless of local context. Urbanisation becomes theater—shiny surface, brittle underneath.

## Beyond Growth: Questions, Not Prescriptions

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If neoliberalism traps us in endless competition and dependency locks us into imitating the North, what's the alternative? Scholars and activists increasingly point toward **degrowth** and **post-development**—not as solutions to adopt uncritically, but as frameworks for asking better questions.

- **Degrowth** challenges the assumption that endless economic growth equals progress. When Thailand's GDP rises but household debt reaches 90%, when Bangkok builds skyscrapers while citizens go homeless, when provincial economies are gutted to feed capital growth—is this really development? Degrowth asks: growth for whom, and at what cost? What if we measured success not by GDP but by wellbeing: Do people have enough? Are communities thriving? Is the environment sustainable?

- **Post-development** questions whether "development" itself—as a concept invented by the North and imposed on the South—serves our interests at all. Before colonialism, societies had their own ways of organizing and thriving. "Development" reframed these as "backward," creating the problem it claims to solve. Post-development asks: What if we stopped trying to "catch up" to the West and instead built from our own foundations?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**But here's the critical question:** Who decides what "enough" is? If degrowth means the poor should accept less while elites maintain comfort, it becomes another tool of oppression. If post-development romanticizes poverty as "authentic," it perpetuates inequality under a different name. The value of these frameworks isn't in their prescriptions but in forcing us to ask: **What do we actually need? What makes life meaningful here? Who benefits from calling this "development"?**

## Purpose and Power

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the youth inheriting this world: rejecting neoliberal performance doesn't mean accepting your current position as fate. That would simply replace one trap with another. A population that stops demanding better is easier to exploit.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means practically: **Reject the ladder of status performance, but don't stop pursuing what you genuinely need.** Choose meaningful work over impressive titles—if you can afford it. Support cooperative businesses—while demanding progressive taxation. Celebrate cultural practices—but don't fossilize them; some traditions were oppressive. Question Western validation—but learning English for opportunity isn't betrayal.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most importantly: Question everything. When someone tells you to be satisfied with less, ask if they're satisfied with less. Interrogate every paradigm—neoliberal growth and its alternatives alike—for whose interests it truly serves. **Agency requires power, and power requires resources. Don't let anyone convince you that powerlessness is liberation.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neoliberalism sells the illusion we can buy completeness. Dependency ensures we keep seeking external validation. But poorly-applied alternatives can serve the same function: keeping you in your place. **Real development should give us more options, not fewer. More power to shape our lives, not resignation to circumstances.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember those glass towers? They're not inherently bad. The problem is the meaning we've assigned them—and who decided that meaning and who benefits from it. Cities can be modern and distinctive. Development can honor identity while engaging the world. The question is whether we do so as agents defining our own path, or as performers chasing validation we'll never receive.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The watch, the car, the degree, the skyline—all can be meaningful if they reflect genuine purpose. But so can their absence, if genuinely chosen rather than imposed. This generation's task isn't to stop developing, but to **develop differently**: building societies where growth serves human flourishing; where success is self-defined; where we have enough power to ask what "enough" means—and enough resources to achieve it.
