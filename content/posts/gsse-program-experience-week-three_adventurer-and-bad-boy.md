&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh boy, it's the third week already. Time sure flies when you're studying. Anyhow, this week we all went to our first adventure at River City, I ended up skipping class for the first time, and who knew researching can be so frustrating? I sure didn't.

## First Field Trip of the Program!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since this class is the first class held outside of our usual Rangsit campus, I reseached about the professor, Professor Micheal Hornblow. Seeing his background he sure measure up to expectations. Really fun guy and a great time within his lecture. Of course, we started off the day with another lecture–it was about "Social Change in Art and Design" by the way. Nothing much of note, other than there was a guest speaker who (if I recalled correctly) co-founded the Bangkok Arts and Culture Center–BACC for short. So that was cool.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the afternoon rolls around, we set off to River City which is an "Arts & Antiques is a shopping center" we set of the see an exibition called "I need a life coach" by the comedian Udom Taephanich more commonly known by his nickname Note. There was some "Artistic" liberties with his artworks, here are some that I took photos of:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you can see his paintings and sculpture tends to either have a similiar sillowet of a dad bod or be body-less. He also plays around a lot with the use of textures and colors within his artworks. We all looked through the exibition rather quickly because to be completely truthful to you, dear reader, none of us are really art aficionados. I mean some were, so I may not speak for everyone. Anyhow, being in an exitbition did not hamper our joy and we all had some fun.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After River City, we went off for an adventure the a historic neighbourhood in Bangkok known as "Talat Noi". We went there to explore it's community the impact sociatal change and art within the area. It was a fun trip that only thing is that, my roommate was practically dying in the sun. And everyone was melting like a popsicle in Arizona.
