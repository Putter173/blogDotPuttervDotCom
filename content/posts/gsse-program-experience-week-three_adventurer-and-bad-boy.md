&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh boy, it's the third week already. Time sure flies when you're studying. Anyhow, this week we all went to our first adventure at River City, I ended up skipping class for the first time, and who knew researching can be so frustrating? I sure didn't.

## First Field Trip of the Program!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since this class is the first class held outside of our usual Rangsit campus, I reseach about the professor, Professor Micheal Hornblow. Seeing his background he sure measure up to expectations. Really fun guy and a great time within his lecture. Of course, we started off the day with another lecture–it was about "Social Change in Art and Design" by the way. Nothing much of note, other than there was a guest speaker who (if I recalled correctly) co-founded the Bangkok Arts and Culture Center–BACC for short.
