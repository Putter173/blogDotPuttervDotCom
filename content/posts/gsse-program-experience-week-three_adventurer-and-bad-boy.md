&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh boy, it's the third week already. Time sure flies when you're studying. Anyhow, this week we all went to our first adventure at River City, I ended up skipping class for the first time, and who knew researching can be so frustrating? I sure didn't.

## First Field Trip of the Program!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since this class is the first class held outside of our usual Rangsit campus, I reseached about the professor, Professor Micheal Hornblow. Seeing his background he sure measure up to expectations. Really fun guy and a great time within his lecture. Of course, we started off the day with another lecture–it was about "Social Change in Art and Design" by the way. Nothing much of note, other than there was a guest speaker who (if I recalled correctly) co-founded the Bangkok Arts and Culture Center–BACC for short. So that was cool.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the afternoon rolls around, we set off to River City which is an "Arts & Antiques is a shopping center" we set of the see an exibition called "I need a life coach" by the comedian Udom Taephanich more commonly known by his nickname Note. There was some "Artistic" liberties with his artworks, here are some that I took photos of:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you can see his paintings and sculpture tends to either have a similiar sillowet of a dad bod or be body-less. He also plays around a lot with the use of textures and colors within his artworks. We all looked through the exibition rather quickly because to be completely truthful to you, dear reader, none of us are really art aficionados. I mean some were, so I may not speak for everyone. Anyhow, being in an exitbition did not hamper our joy and we all had some fun.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After River City, we went off for an adventure the a historic neighbourhood in Bangkok known as "Talat Noi". We went there to explore it's community the impact sociatal change and art within the area. It was a fun trip that only thing is that, my roommate was practically dying in the sun. And everyone was melting like a popsicle in Arizona.

## Project!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tuesday, a day which our class meant for helping us with our SPPC (Summer Pre-Program Course) project felt like another project meeting. And there's nothing wrong with that, it was some fun working with the mates.

## Bad to the bone.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wednesday! A day of a day, what need I say more. It's one day of the week where, yet again we discussed about what we want to be in our future, of course there's nothing wrong with that but we aleady been on that since day one so for me and a mate of mine it was qute repetitive and we felt like our time would much be more useful doing our projects. So we did exactly that, he worked on our SPPC project while I worked on my team's project for the Circular Innovation Challenge (CIC). I mean I guess it wasn't that bad, but still skipping class was something I hadn't done before.

## Being Doctor Psycho

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you didn't get that refence either go watch more superhero cartoons or go read comic books now! Lol just kidding, but you should know this charecter. Basically, on Thursday we had a lectured by Professor Neil. We somehow met up with the professor before class, only to all realized the document was wrong it wasn't room 2018 no, we were sent back to the 3rd century to room 218. But hey that lecture was fun! I love psychology, I mean who doesn't?

## Friday Another Project Day

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CIC project was due on Saturday, unfortunately I had exams. And I mean don't we all want to get our work done before the deadline? So that's exactly what we did, for countless hours we looked over articles and reseach papers and even patents to make our case within the challenge. Happy to say that we submitted that a full day and about fifteen mintues to spare.

## First Uniform Day

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday time, time of Saturn? I don't know where I was going with that. But hey, it's my first day wearing the university uniform. And it also happens to be the day in which we have the dreaded TU-Greats exam. I mean to be honest I don't really see the use of it's content rather than molding student s into a certian mindset Aka. A brainwasing subject but you know what I ain't blaming the university for this, I'm blaming the Ministry of Education. Yup, I'm doing my generation's thing of blaming the big brother goverment. And also after I finished the exam I went back to my dorm to write this refection so cool? I guess?
