&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week is the final week of the Summer Pre-Program Course! Woohoo! In this week we adventure towards the second and third orientations, recording a podcast, the final lecture, special video edit, project presentations, and even going to the â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ. If this week seems more full of content than the last, it's definitely not because I'm not on a phone call this time ðŸ˜….

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First off, apologies for the smuge in the middle, I stiched together one of my Instagram stories for this. Secondly, of couse our entire university freshman of 2022 couldn't possibly fit into this single assembly lol, we're just one of the many groups that were divided. And of course those empty seats did eventually all got filled up by the time the orentation started.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be frank, I do not recommend attending this event if you do not know or are not comtrable in the Thai language. As a student of an international program it's far better to just avoid this. It was quite an experience, not understanding anything well I'm exargerrating of course, but understading a language and understading the humour and all the context nassary is a whole other can of worms. For me, the only entertaining thing that came out of this was the stage show they've organized (pictured below) to introduce us to the university's app and certian rules and regulations of the university (such as our relazed dress code for example). This is probaly due to the fact that I left the event early to fulfil accommplish a task, more on that later, making me unable to attend the afternoon session. Though, one of my friend later informed that in her words "it was quite brainwashy." After that there was a concert, but I'm not really one for concerts so nothing further shall be mentioned about that here.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On to the afternoon of the orentation day, I skipped it! Yeah, I skipped something again ðŸ˜…. Now let's talk about that task I mentioned earlier. We went to record a podcast, by "we" I mean my dear friends Acre and Namo. Yup, that's spelled correctly, it's not Nemo guys it's Namo. The podcast is called "Don't Know" but we're still figuring everything out even as I write this blog.
