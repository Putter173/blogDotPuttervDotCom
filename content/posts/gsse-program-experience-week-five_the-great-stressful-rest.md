&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week is the final week of the Summer Pre-Program Course! Woohoo! In this week we adventure towards the second and third orientations, recording a podcast, the final lecture, special video edit, and our project presentation. If this week seems more full of content than the last, it's definitely not because I'm not on a phone call this time ðŸ˜….

## Thammasat University's University-Wide Orientation Day

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First off, apologies for the smuge in the middle, I stiched together one of my Instagram stories for this. Secondly, of couse our entire university freshman of 2022 couldn't possibly fit into this single assembly lol, we're just one of the many groups that were divided. And of course those empty seats did eventually all got filled up by the time the orentation started.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be frank, I do not recommend attending this event if you do not know or are not comtrable in the Thai language. As a student of an international program it's far better to just avoid this. It was quite an experience, not understanding anything well I'm exargerrating of course, but understading a language and understading the humour and all the context nassary is a whole other can of worms. For me, the only entertaining thing that came out of this was the stage show they've organized (pictured below) to introduce us to the university's app and certian rules and regulations of the university (such as our relazed dress code for example). This is probaly due to the fact that I left the event early to fulfil accommplish a task, more on that later, making me unable to attend the afternoon session. Though, one of my friend later informed that in her words "it was quite brainwashy." After that there was a concert, but I'm not really one for concerts so nothing further shall be mentioned about that here.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On to the afternoon of the orentation day, I skipped it! Yeah, I skipped something again ðŸ˜…. Now let's talk about that task I mentioned earlier. We went to record a podcast, by "we" I mean my dear friends Acre and Namo. Yup, that's spelled correctly, it's not Nemo guys it's Namo. The podcast is called "Don't Know" but we're still figuring everything out even as I write this blog.

## Last Lecture of SPPC

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This final lecture was conducted by Professor.Istvan, this lecture was basically the summery of what GSSE is and what will be in-store for us in our first semester and beyond.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been asigned, to make a video summerizing the whole entire Summer Pre-Program Course, since if I recalled correctly the third week of the course. So of course I've asked my dear friend Huggy to the the hardest part editing the entire thing. This video was then shown at our Impact Fest more of that in a bit. This was mainly done on Tuesday, which was supposed to be a "rest" day for us, but then I had to go and accept more tasks because well that's what I do I guess?

{{< /rawhtml >}}

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time finally arrived for us to present our project that we've been doing throughout the entire course. I will not talk about the project because the presentation should speak for itself. It was incredibily stressful presenting everythin within the ten mintute time frame, and add on the fact that we're the first group to present that should be at least twenty percent of the stress rushing through my veins that day. Unfortunately, we did not achieve top two and the ranking below that wasn't announced. So congrtulations, to those guys particularly Yuttika, Yohan, Hsu, Borey, Set, Shotaru, and Hnin they all made it to the top two! But on a more selfishly positive side, me and Acre won the GSSE Inspirer award voted by our peers. I'd then like to take the oppotunity thank my mates who voted.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yup, there's another "orentation" to be fair this one isn't required. And earlier it was reffered to as the "club showcase". It was another Thai event, so if you're like me and don't really "get" Thai then I recomend not attending. And wait for a sucker like me to attend it for you instead. It was basically what it was originally refered to, so just a showcase of a lot of clubs within Thammasat University including: Thai Music Club, Thai Dance Club, MC (Master of Ceremonies) Club, TEDx Club, EQ (Emotional Quotient) Club, and poetentially more (I already sat for four hours, my buttoxs were hurting like hell sorry guys.) I know I said it's "just a showcase" earlier, but there was some bands there too such as: Pramount, Electric Neon Lamp, Scrubb, and Whal & Dolph. To which, I know non of them because I don't listen to Thai music. I mean What did you expect from me?
